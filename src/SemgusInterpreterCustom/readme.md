This project contains an implementation of an interpreter and enumerative synthesis solver for SemGuS, along with a utilities library.

Tests and examples for these projects will also be housed in this repository.

NOTE: several of the projects in this repository reference the `ParserLibrary` project. To keep these references intact, make sure to clone this repository into the same parent folder as [Semgus-Parser](https://github.com/SemGuS-git/Semgus-Parser).
