# SemGuS solvers with Rosette and Sketch

This repository contains my work in creating a SemGuS solver based in Rosette and Sketch. Each are designated into their own C# project directories.
Note that they use the parser as a dependency and at the moment it requires that the SemGuS-Parser directory exist directly outside this repository.
